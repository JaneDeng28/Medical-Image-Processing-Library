# Medical-Image-Processing-Library
Medical Image-Processing Library for Bone Fraction Image

We plan to develop a deep learning model to classify medical diagnostic images of patientâ€™s hand bone abnormal from those are normal. We decided to use dataset from bone X-Ray Deep Learning Competition of Stanford MURA ML: https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/

## Tasks may include:
- data cleaning and selection
- Examine and understand data
- Build an input pipeline
- Build the model
- Train the model
- Test the model
- Improve the model and repeat the process
- ...

## Packages may include: 
- tensorflow
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- torch
- cv2
- ...

## Functions may include:
- Load/correct file path
- Load image from path
- Convert list X and y to array
- Test train split
- Build model
- Train model
- Plot accuracy

#### A medical image-processing library will be built, output will be binary - whether the result is normal(negative) or abnormal(positive) based on the image provided
