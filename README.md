# Medical-Image-Processing-Library
Medical Image-Processing Library for Bone Fraction Image

We plan to develop a deep learning model to classify medical diagnostic images of patient’s hand bone fracture from those are not. We decided to use dataset from bone X-Ray Deep Learning Competition of Stanford MURA ML: https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/

Task will include data cleaning and selection, training model and classification method selection, and achieve an acceptable accuracy. Then a medical image-processing library will be built, and output will be whether the result is based on the image provided.

Function may include: Load image from path, convert list X and y to array, test train split, create model, train the model, and plot accuracy.
